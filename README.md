# 03-Password-Generator
 Week 3 Homework--functional password generator

 This is my homework for week 3.

 The webpage creates a randomly generated password for the user. The user is prompted to select the password length (between 8 and 120 characters). The user is then prompted with a series of Y/N questions asking whether to include a certain type of character (numerics, upper case, lower case, or special characters).  

 If the user fails to specify ANY type of character, an error alert pops up and the program ends.

 If the user specifies a password length that is not a number between 8 and 120, it sends and error message and then calls itself.
